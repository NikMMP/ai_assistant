Three friends

Once upon a time there lived three best friends in the forest: Maxim the Bear, Sigmund the Bunny and Polina the Bird. They spent all their days together, playing and helping each other.

One day, when the spring sun called on nature to wake up, the forest was gripped by a great disaster - the stream, the source of all the water in the forest, had dried up! The animals were in despair, because without water they were in danger.

Maxim the Bear suggested going in search of a new source of water. Sigmund the Bunny agreed immediately, and Polina the Bird gathered her feathered friends to help search.

They crossed mountains and meadows until they finally found a deep and clear spring. All the animals gathered around to thank Maxim the Bear, Sigmund the Bunny and Polina the Bird for their efforts.

From then on, they took care of the water in the forest so that they would never find themselves in such a situation again. And they lived happily ever after, knowing that friendship and solidarity would help them overcome any difficulties.
